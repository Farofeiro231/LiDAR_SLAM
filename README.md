# LiDAR_SLAM
Repository related to the development of a SLAM algorithm using a 2D LiDAR for my college's robotics club.

This project is intended to create a UKF code for the localization of a mobile robot. The sensor used with the filter is a 2D LiDAR.
I'm tackling this problem by using multiprocessing/multithreading to execute data capture and processing at the same time; 
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for data visualization; and a Class-based approach to keep data from landmarks, the robot and the
system itself.
